## Site Description

The website enables face detection and recognition in videos. Users can upload photos of the people they want to recognize. If a matching face is detected in the video, it is labeled with the corresponding name.

---

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Automatically detects all faces in the frame.
- **Photo Upload for Recognition**: Users can upload photos of people they want to identify.
- **Saving Unknown Faces**: Faces not recognized among the uploaded photos are saved for later processing.
- **Face Identification**: Recognized faces are labeled with names in the video.
- **Labeling Unknown Faces**: Faces seen multiple times are labeled with a unique index.

---

## Example Usage

1. The user uploads photos of people. The photo filename should match the personâ€™s name.
2. The website processes the photo using FaceNet and generates a file with embeddings. Uploaded photos are displayed on the site.
3. The user uploads a video.
4. The processed video is displayed on the website with detected faces labeled by name.
